Simulations for finding approximate probabilities of (5) card hands.

	node --test-only pair.mjs # pair ~= 0.49

	node --test-only suits.mjs # 2 of same suit = 1
	                           # 3 of same suit ~= 0.37 (37% chance)
	                           # 4 of same suit ~= 0.04 (4% chance)
	                           # 5 of same suit ~= 0.002 (0.2% chance)

Omit the `--test-only` option to also run unit tests.
