Simulations for finding approximate probabilities of (5) card hands.

	node pair.mjs	# pair ~= 0.49 (49% chance)

	node suits.mjs	# 2 of same suit = 1
			# 3 of same suit ~= 0.37 (37% chance)
			# 4 of same suit ~= 0.04 (4% chance)
			# 5 of same suit ~= 0.002 (0.2% chance)

	node run.js	# Run of 3: ~22% (25% when Aces are high and low)
			# Run of 4: ~3% (4% when Aces are high and low)
			# Run of 5: ~0.3% (0.5% when Aces are high and low)

To run unit tests: node --test
