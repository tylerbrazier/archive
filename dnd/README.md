D&D (5e) notes and character sheets

Notes are compact so they can all be fit on one printed page (front and back).

Character sheets are designed to be annotated during the game (e.g. HP changes, spell slots, etc.) and can be periodically updated electronically and reprinted (e.g. between sessions or at each level up). Version control allows a character to be replayed at any point in the past.

Plain text printed on 8.5x11 paper appears to have a width of 107 characters before wrapping (see print preview).
