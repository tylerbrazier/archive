# Link rig

**archived in favor of just having either a markdown file in my notes repo or a
bookmarks repo of its own (so commits don't clutter notes) or a gist**

Bookmark manager using bookmarks.html file hosted on [github][].
The file is in [Netscape's HTML format][], which is kind of terrible but pretty
much the de facto for import/export on all major browsers.

I started this project because I wanted a way to view and search my bookmarks
in a public webpage hosted on [github.io][]. I use multiple browsers so this
would make a good home page.
