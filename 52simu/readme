Simulations for finding approximate probabilities of (5) card hands.
For a 52 card deck:

	pair ~= 0.49 (49% chance)
	3 of a kind ~= 0.022 (2% chance)
	4 of a kind ~= 0.0002 (0.02% chance)
	(two pair ~= 0.047 (4.7% chance, from the link below))

	3 of same suit ~= 0.37 (37% chance)
	4 of same suit ~= 0.044 (4% chance)
	5 of same suit ~= 0.002 (0.2% chance)

	Run of 3: ~22% (25% when Aces are high and low)
	Run of 4: ~3% (4% when Aces are high and low)
	Run of 5: ~0.3% (0.5% when Aces are high and low)

	Marriage (K&Q): 99705/1000000 = 0.099705
	Marriage or Bezique (K&Q | J&Q): 176566/1000000 = 0.176566
	Any two different faces: 253054/1000000 = 0.253054

For a 40 card with two red kings and no black kings:

	Pair: 491769/1000000 = 0.491769
	Three of a kind: 22838/1000000 = 0.022838
	Four of a kind: 254/1000000 = 0.000254
	Two Pair: 48381/1000000 = 0.048381
	Three Pair (6 card hand): 3018/1000000 = 0.003018
	Four Pair (8 card hand): 62786/1000000 = 0.062786

	3 of same suit: 371542/1000000 = 0.371542
	4 of same suit: 44680/1000000 = 0.04468
	5 of same suit: 1979/1000000 = 0.001979
	6 of same suit (6 card hand): 345/1000000 = 0.000345

	Run size 3:
	Aces low only: 231252/1000000 = 0.231252
	Aces high only: 224667/1000000 = 0.224667
	Aces high and low: 256591/1000000 = 0.256591
	Run size 4:
	Aces low only: 40974/1000000 = 0.040974
	Aces high only: 39068/1000000 = 0.039068
	Aces high and low: 48536/1000000 = 0.048536
	Run size 5:
	Aces low only: 3873/1000000 = 0.003873
	Aces high only: 3847/1000000 = 0.003847
	Aces high and low: 5117/1000000 = 0.005117
	Run size 6 (6 card hand):
	Aces low only: 1823/1000000 = 0.001823
	Aces high only: 1741/1000000 = 0.001741
	Aces high and low: 2613/1000000 = 0.002613
