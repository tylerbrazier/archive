Pacman - A quick & dirty game written in javascript that I made in collage.

Follow these steps to set up hosting for Pacman on a Linux/Unix host.

You will need a database and a single table for storing player names, scores,
and times. You will also need to modify a file to work with your new database
setup.

$ cd <web root>/pacman
# cp conf.php.example conf.php

Now edit the values in conf.php to match your database and table setup.
A note to developers: conf.php is already listed in .gitignore so that private
database information isn't made public incase you push to a public repo.
