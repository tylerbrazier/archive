## treestump
A [NERDTree][0] plugin that adds keybindings for copy (`<c-c>`),
paste (`<c-v>`), etc.

Currently, there's bindings for:

- copy `<c-c>`
- cut `<c-x>`
- paste `<c-v>`
- delete `<del>`

### TODO
- Copy/paste should use the system clipboard (if available) instead of
  an internal clipboard variable
- Be able to copy,paste into the same directory and rename the new file
